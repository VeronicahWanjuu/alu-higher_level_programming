# Python - Almost a Circle

This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at ALX. It focuses on building a simple object-oriented structure for modeling geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. It demonstrates the use of inheritance, unit testing, and PEP 8 coding standards.

## Project Overview

The project defines three classes:

- `Base`: A base class that provides a unique ID for every instance.
- `Rectangle`: A subclass of `Base` that models a rectangle with width and height.
- `Square`: A subclass of `Rectangle` that models a square, a specific case of a rectangle where width and height are equal.

Additionally, the project includes unit tests for each class to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
